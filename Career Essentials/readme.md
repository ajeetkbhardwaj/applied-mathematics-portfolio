How our non-verbal govern, how people think and feel about us but the question is do our non-verbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves ?

Our mind change our bodies but it's also true that do our bodies change our minds. The mind of powerfull vs powerless - harmones.

powerfull people don't always assertive, confident, optimistic but they actually feels that i will win the game if given a chance because they able to think abstractly and take more risks.

physiologically they also differes like testotrones and cartosole harmones. how to react in stress and normal and happy.

can power posing for few minutes really change my like in a meaningfull ways ?  and where should i use it ? evaluated social threats.

Who to hire ? powerfull poses or stressfull ? so hiring is not about the content of the speech but mine Presence = {passionate, confident, Enthuiastic, Authentic, Captivating, Comfortable}

Qualification etc does't affect interview but the your presence can really.

Our bodies change our minds and our minds change our behaviour and our behavour changes our outcomes. it seems fake but Fake it to make it.

Don't fake it untill you make it but fake it untill you become it.
