    "##### Problem-1 : Find the maximum depth or height of a binary tree\n",
    "Given a binary tree, the task is to find the maximum height of the tree. The height of the tree is the number of edges in the tree from the root to the deepest node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a binary tree T = (V, E) where V = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and E = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (2, 4)] can be viewed as \n",
    "\n",
    "![bg fit](image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "the levels of the tree is \n",
    "* L-0 : [1]\n",
    "* L-1 : [2, 3]\n",
    "* L-2 : [4, 5]\n",
    "* L-3 : [6, 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "thus the maximum height of the binary tree will be the h = 3 because it has the depth of d = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different approaches to attack this problem \n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Recursion :**\n",
    "\n",
    "We recursively calculate the height of the left and the right subtrees of a node and assign height to the node as max of the heights of two children plus \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the tree is empty, return -1.\n",
    "2. Otherwise, do the following:\n",
    "   * Get the height of the left subtree recursively, i.e., call height(node->left).\n",
    "   * Get the height of the right subtree recursively, i.e., call height(node->right).\n",
    "   * Compute the maximum of the heights of the left and right subtrees and add 1 to it for the current node.\n",
    "   * height = max(height of left subtree, height of right subtree) + 1.\n",
    "3. Return the height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Complexity is O(n) and O(h) is time and space complexity resp.where n is number of nodes and height of binary tree\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Level Order Traversal :\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept is if we take a closer look at the depth first traversal, we can notice that after we process the last node of the current level, the next level is completely in the queue. We use this property and insert a special NULL into the queue to indicate end of a level.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Traverse the tree in level order traversal starting from root.\n",
    "2. Initialize an empty queue q, a variable height and push root, then push null into the q to indicate end of the first level.\n",
    "3. Run a while loop till q is not empty\n",
    "   * Store the front element of q and pop out the front element.\n",
    "   * If the front of q is NULL, it means we have processed the last node of current level and complete next level is in the queue. So we increment height and insert a NULL for end of the next level.\n",
    "   * Else if the element is not NULL then check for its left and right children and if they are not NULL push them into q.\n",
    "4. Return height – 1, as the number of edges encountered will be one less than number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of the same concept that when we process the last node of a current level, the next level is completely in the queue. Instead of adding a null in the Queue. Simply increase the counter when the level increases and push the children of current node into the queue, then remove all the nodes from the queue of the current Level."
